# git-profil-card

"I've created this GitHub profile card using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It dynamically fetches data from the GitHub API to display my current stats. Feel free to check out my repositories and follow me for updates on my projects."

This text gives a brief description of your GitHub profile card and what it does. You can customize it to better describe your own card and your GitHub activities if needed.
